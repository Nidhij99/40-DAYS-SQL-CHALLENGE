-- Q. Find the median within a series of numbers in SQL ?

with cte as(
			select views, 
			row_number() over(order by views asc) as rn_asc,
			row_number() over(order by views desc) as rn_desc from tiktok) -- =1 is used in even case , in case of odd we need =0 so use >=1 then also it is zero.
select avg(views) as median from cte where abs(rn_asc - rn_desc) =1; -- code for postgresql

with cte as (
		select views, count(*) over() as total_count,
			row_number() over(order by views asc) as rn 
		from tiktok)
select avg(views) as median from cte 
where rn in (FLOOR((total_count+1)/2), CEIL((total_count+1)/2));  -- for mysql
